# file-management
node-js project for learning

This project so far has 2 APIs
    * List all the directories and its files (recursively)
    * Renaming the video SRT files to match the name of the video. (so that VLC can pick it up automatically) 

*It is also configured to run on server port 8080, just in case if you want to run the app using REST*
